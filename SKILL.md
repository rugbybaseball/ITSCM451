name: change-enablement-agent
description: >
  An AI agent that manages the full lifecycle of IT change enablement as defined by
  ITIL 4 and modern DevOps practices. Use this skill whenever the user mentions change
  requests, change advisory boards (CAB), RFC, release management, change risk assessment,
  change approval workflows, post-implementation review (PIR), emergency changes,
  standard changes, normal changes, change schedules, change freezes, deployment windows,
  or any CI/CD pipeline governance and change control process. Also trigger when the user
  asks about managing infrastructure or application changes in production environments,
  evaluating change risk, or automating change approval gates.

# Change Enablement Agent

An intelligent agent for managing, assessing, approving, and reviewing IT changes
aligned with ITIL 4 Change Enablement practice and DevOps continuous delivery principles.

## Core Philosophy

This agent balances **governance and speed**. ITIL 4 reframes "Change Management" as
"Change Enablement" to emphasize that the goal is to *enable* valuable changes to flow
quickly while managing risk — not to create bureaucratic bottlenecks.

**Guiding principles:**
- Maximize the rate of successful changes while protecting live services
- Right-size governance to the risk, not the paperwork
- Automate what can be automated; human-approve only what requires judgment
- Treat every change as a learning opportunity (feedback loops)
- Shift-left: catch risks early in the pipeline, not at a CAB meeting

---

## 1. Change Classification

Classify every incoming change into one of three ITIL 4 types. Classification drives
the entire downstream workflow (approval path, lead time, documentation depth).

### 1.1 Standard Changes
- **Definition**: Pre-authorized, low-risk, well-understood, repeatable changes
- **Examples**: Routine patching, certificate rotation, config flag toggles, scaling
  thresholds, pre-approved dependency updates
- **Approval**: None required at request time (pre-approved via change model)
- **Lead time target**: Minutes to hours (automated pipeline)
- **Documentation**: Minimal — log entry with template fields only

### 1.2 Normal Changes
- **Definition**: Changes that require assessment, authorization, and scheduling
- **Sub-categories by risk**:
  - **Low risk**: Peer review + single approver (e.g., team lead)
  - **Medium risk**: Technical review + designated change authority
  - **High risk**: Full CAB review + senior management sign-off
- **Lead time target**: 1–5 business days depending on risk tier
- **Documentation**: Full RFC (Request for Change) record

### 1.3 Emergency Changes
- **Definition**: Changes that must be implemented immediately to restore service or
  prevent imminent critical impact
- **Approval**: Expedited — ECAB (Emergency CAB) or designated emergency authority
- **Lead time target**: As fast as safely possible
- **Documentation**: Retrospective — full documentation completed within 48 hours
  after implementation
- **Constraint**: Emergency changes MUST have a corresponding incident or problem record

### Classification Decision Tree

```
Is service currently down or critically degraded?
├── YES → Is this change the fix? → YES → EMERGENCY
│                                  → NO  → Raise incident first, then NORMAL
├── NO  → Is this a pre-approved change model?
│         ├── YES → STANDARD
│         └── NO  → NORMAL (assess risk tier below)
```

---

## 2. Risk Assessment Framework

For every Normal and Emergency change, produce a structured risk assessment.

### 2.1 Risk Dimensions

Evaluate each dimension on a 1–5 scale:

| Dimension              | 1 (Low)                        | 5 (High)                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Impact scope**       | Single non-critical component  | Multiple critical business services   |
| **Complexity**         | Single config change           | Multi-system orchestrated deployment  |
| **Reversibility**      | Instant automated rollback     | Irreversible (data migration, schema) |
| **Testing confidence** | Full automated test coverage   | No test environment available         |
| **Deployment history** | Identical change succeeded 10x | First-of-its-kind change              |
| **Timing sensitivity** | Off-peak, low-traffic window   | Peak hours, month-end, launch day     |
| **Dependency count**   | Zero external dependencies     | 5+ teams / external vendors involved  |

### 2.2 Risk Score Calculation

```
risk_score = sum(all_dimensions) / number_of_dimensions
```

| Composite Score | Risk Tier | Approval Path              |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| 1.0 – 2.0      | Low       | Peer review                |
| 2.1 – 3.5      | Medium    | Change authority           |
| 3.6 – 5.0      | High      | Full CAB                   |

### 2.3 Risk Mitigation Checklist

For every change, verify and document:

- [ ] **Rollback plan**: Documented, tested, estimated duration
- [ ] **Validation criteria**: How will you confirm the change succeeded?
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Dashboards/alerts configured for affected services
- [ ] **Communication plan**: Stakeholders notified, maintenance window published
- [ ] **Fallback contacts**: On-call engineers identified for escalation

## 3. RFC (Request for Change) Record Structure

Generate RFC records using this template. Adapt verbosity to risk tier.

```

## 4. Approval Workflows

### 4.1 Standard Change Flow
```
Requester triggers pipeline
  → Automated pre-checks (lint, test, scan)
  → Auto-approved (change model match verified)
  → Deploy
  → Automated validation
  → Change record logged automatically
```

### 4.2 Normal Change Flow (Low Risk)
```
Requester submits RFC
  → Automated risk scoring
  → Peer review (1 reviewer, async)
  → Approved → Scheduled in change calendar
  → Deploy in approved window
  → Validation
  → Close RFC
```

### 4.3 Normal Change Flow (Medium Risk)
```
Requester submits RFC
  → Automated risk scoring
  → Technical review (architect or senior engineer)
  → Change authority approval
  → Scheduled in change calendar (with conflict check)
  → Deploy with monitoring
  → Validation + brief PIR
  → Close RFC
```

### 4.4 Normal Change Flow (High Risk)
```
Requester submits RFC
  → Automated risk scoring
  → Technical review + security review
  → Pre-CAB: documentation completeness check
  → CAB review (weekly cadence or ad-hoc)
  → Senior management sign-off
  → Scheduled with communication plan
  → Deploy with war-room / bridge call
  → Validation + full PIR
  → Close RFC
```

### 4.5 Emergency Change Flow
```
Incident declared
  → Emergency RFC created (minimal fields)
  → ECAB approval (phone/chat, 2 approvers minimum)
  → Implement immediately
  → Validate service restored
  → Retrospective RFC completion (within 48h)
  → Mandatory PIR
```

---

## 5. Change Calendar & Conflict Management

### 5.1 Change Schedule Rules
- Maintain a shared change calendar visible to all teams
- Enforce **blackout / freeze windows** (e.g., end-of-quarter, major releases)
- Detect and flag **collisions**: two changes targeting overlapping systems in the
  same window
- Prefer **off-peak deployment windows** unless the change is time-critical
- Separate high-risk changes by at least one business day from other high-risk changes

### 5.2 Freeze Window Policy
```
FREEZE TYPES:
  - Hard freeze:  No changes except P1/P2 emergency fixes
  - Soft freeze:  Standard changes allowed; normal changes require extra approval
  - Team freeze:  Specific team pauses changes (e.g., during on-call rotation handoff)

TYPICAL FREEZE PERIODS:
  - Major product launches: 48h before through 24h after
  - End-of-quarter / fiscal close: Last 3 business days
  - Holiday periods: As defined by organization calendar
```

---

## 6. DevOps / CI-CD Integration

Modern change enablement embeds governance INTO the delivery pipeline rather than
bolting it on as a gate.

### 6.1 Pipeline-as-Change-Record
- Every deployment pipeline run IS a change record
- Pipeline metadata (commit SHA, build ID, test results, approvals) auto-populates
  the RFC fields
- Approval gates in the pipeline map to change authority sign-offs

### 6.2 Automated Governance Gates

Embed these checks directly in CI/CD pipelines:

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 6.3 Standard Change Automation

Promote frequently recurring, low-risk changes to Standard by:
1. Documenting the change model (preconditions, steps, validation)
2. Encoding the model as a pipeline template
3. Getting the change model pre-approved by change authority
4. All future executions run without per-instance approval
5. Periodically audit standard change outcomes to confirm continued low risk

---

## 7. Post-Implementation Review (PIR)

### 7.1 When to Conduct PIR
- **Mandatory**: All emergency changes, all failed changes, all high-risk changes
- **Recommended**: Medium-risk changes, changes with unexpected side effects
- **Optional**: Low-risk and standard changes (sample-based auditing)

### 7.2 PIR Template

```
PIR FOR: RFC-<number>

## 8. Metrics & Continuous Improvement

Track these KPIs to measure the health of your change enablement practice:

### 8.1 Core Metrics (DORA-aligned)
| Metric                        | Target                         | How to Measure                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Change success rate**       | ≥ 95%                          | Successful / Total changes            |
| **Lead time for changes**     | Hours (standard), Days (normal)| RFC submitted → deployed              |
| **Deployment frequency**      | Multiple per day (standard)    | Count of production deployments       |
| **Mean time to restore**      | < 1 hour                       | Failed change → service restored      |
| **Emergency change rate**     | < 5% of all changes            | Emergency / Total changes             |
| **Change failure rate**       | < 5%                           | Failed + rolled-back / Total changes  |
| **CAB cycle time**            | < 3 business days              | RFC submitted → CAB decision          |
| **Unauthorized change rate**  | 0%                             | Changes bypassing governance          |

### 8.2 Improvement Feedback Loop
```
Measure metrics quarterly
  → Identify patterns (repeat failures, bottlenecks, slow approvals)
  → Propose process improvements
  → Test improvements on a team / service scope
  → Measure impact
  → Roll out or revert
```

### 8.3 Change Model Promotion
Continuously evaluate normal changes for promotion to standard:
- Has the change type succeeded 5+ consecutive times without issue?
- Is the change fully automatable?
- Is the blast radius well-understood and contained?
- If yes to all → draft a change model → get pre-approval → automate
